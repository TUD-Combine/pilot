# Combine: a pilot

While open science has become the norm in research, academic education still largely relies on static printed textbooks. Adopting concepts from open data, open software, and the very successful Wikipedia project, we propose an innovative alternative: interactive textbooks. ‘Interactive’ here has three meanings. First, the books will be interactive for their users, with all the features the modern web allows. Second, they will also be interactive for their authors, allowing for easy adaptation, mixing, updating, and sharing. Third, interactive textbooks can be co-created by teachers and students, allowing students to reach higher levels of learning. By allowing students to take notes, practice directly in their textbook environment, and see code behind plots and animations, they can study more effectively. By allowing teachers to share, remix and update with ease, textbooks become living documents. And by co-creation, both teachers and students get much further than they could by themselves, gathering more ideas and integrating multiple perspectives.
